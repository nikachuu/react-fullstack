      Hate dog eat half my food and ask for more yet drink water out of the faucet kitty kitty. Stare at imaginary bug slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish. Touch water with paw then recoil in horror sit on human so you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me snuggles up to shoulders or knees and purrs you to sleep.
